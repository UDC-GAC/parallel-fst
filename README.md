# Parallel-FST

## Parallel Feature Selection Toolbox
Feature selection toolbox based on [FEAST](https://github.com/Craigacp/FEAST) and the [MIToolbox](https://github.com/Craigacp/MIToolbox) parallelized with **Threads** and **MPI Processes** for hybrid HPC systems, and using **CUDA** for systems with NVIDIA GPUs.

The project is hosted at GitLab and can be accessed through this link [https://gitlab.com/bieito/parallel-fst/](https://gitlab.com/bieito/parallel-fst/).
